Description
This app is a simple and efficient way to keep your schedule in line. From 9am to 5pm, you can log in exactly what needs to get done and when. It is a planner in computer form, allowing you to jot quick notes down hourly, and return to see what is left to get done. 



Motivation
We all want to stay on top of our day, and simple memory often is not enough to check off everything on the to-do list. This way it comes down to more than memory, keeps us on task, and never missing anything!


Usage
The page is linked to moment.js for the current date and time.

To make a new entry, select the input area between the HOUR on the left and the SAVE BUTTON on the right. Once you've entered your note, click on the SAVE ICON and the Workday Scheduler will remember it! Enter a new note and re-save in the same hour slot to overwrite, if necessary.

Upon the page loading, any pre-existing notes will load into the entry fields.
